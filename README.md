[Ansible role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/loelkes/octoprint) to deploy OctoPrint as systemd services on Debian (or similar, like Raspbian, Ubuntu).

The configuration file is not managed by this role as of now . It will be deleted if the state is set to `absent` in the variables. The restart commands are configured through the OctoPrint configuration CLI.

*Note*: This role and repository should not contain any help or advice on octoprint/ansible/linux/raspberrypi configuration. Please see the manuals for the respective projects for help.
